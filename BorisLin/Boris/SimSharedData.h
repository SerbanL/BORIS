//Container for Simulation class data (Simulation inherits from this) to which other lower ranked objects need access - inherit from this (lower ranked means an object which is a member of Simulation, or a member of a member of Simulation, etc.)
//All members are static, built in the SimulationSharedData constructor
//!!NOTE!!! data in SimulationSharedData could be built in the Simulation constructor, but this may cause problems due to object initialization order. 
//e.g. if Simulation has an object which depends on the data in SimulationSharedData, it will be initialized before the data held here, potentially causing bugs. This can be avoided by declaring that object as a pointer in Simulation and
//making it only after the data here has been initialized, or initializing the data in SimulationSharedData rather than Simulation - this seems preferable as it's foolproof.
