//NOTES:

//Multiple options available for kernel multiplications:
//
//1. Kernels calculated to collect multiple sources (inputs) into single destination (this) - this is the currently used method.
//
//2. Kernel calculated to contribute to multiple destinations from single source (this) - tested this method but comes out slightly slower than 1. and not as elegant to implement.
//Note to calculate these kernels all you need to do is inverse the shift direction, and swap source and destination cellsizes (in 2D irregular mode they can differ).
//Code deleted to reduce clutter but really quick to redo.
//
//3. Partially embedding kernel multiplication into forward FFT. 
//After taking forward FFT, at the last step rather than writing FFT result to F scratch space, perform kernel multiplications for multiple destinations and add result in F2 scratch spaces.
//Thus kernel multiplications embedded with forward FFT, but inverse IFFT completely separate. This means the F scratch space can be half-sized.
//However, this is much slower than 1. and 2. in all scenarios tested. Probably due to constantly flushing cache lines used for forward FFT.
//Abandon this entirely (slight memory saving not worth it); also ugly to implement.
//Code deleted to reduce clutter but really quick to redo.
//
//4. Prioritise kernel cache use. This means kernel multiplications are done so as to minimise kernel reading operations.
//Thus identify kernels which are used multiple times, making a list of sources and destinations for them, then perform multiplications in this order.
//First instinct this should be the best method since it minimises the read operations from kernels; it's also fairly elegant to implement.
//I've done this in SDemag_KernelCollection.h (deleted now - dead code policing!), but it comes out a fair bit slower than method 1. so not in current use.
